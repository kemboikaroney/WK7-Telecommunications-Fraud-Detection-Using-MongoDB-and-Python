# Telecommunications Fraud Detection Using MongoDB and Python

## Project Deliverable
‚óè A GitHub repository with a python file (.py) with your solution.

## Problem Statement
Telecommunications companies need to detect fraudulent activities such as unauthorized use of
premium services or fake billing. Building a data pipeline with MongoDB and Python could help
identify suspicious activity by extracting data from billing systems, call logs, and other sources,
transforming the data to identify patterns or anomalies, and storing it in MongoDB for further
analysis.

## Background Information
Telecommunications companies generate a vast amount of data daily, which can be used to
detect fraud. Fraudulent activity can lead to substantial financial losses and damage the
company's reputation. With the help of data pipelines, companies can detect fraud before it
escalates.
